# ARIMA
* [IBM guide](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/arima-model)
  * Don't worry too much about the math, just try to understand the concepts briefly
  * We choose d such that the data is stationary
* [Choose d to make data stationary](https://youtu.be/UzlDXFJZpZc?si=B1tt0NAxl7z_IJsP)
* [Using ACF and PACF choose p, q](https://youtu.be/ZTm8PJdFS-4?si=sSOQFcoblunkpH0_)
  * After finding range of parameters, we will use grid search, as seen in coding example below
* [Grid search example](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/python-ARIMA-tutorial-influxDB/#heading1)
* (Optional) [Application to stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/autoregressive-integrated-moving-average-arima.asp)

# Neural Networks
* [Google guide](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/neural-networks)
  * Complete *Introduction* through *Backpropagation* sections
* [Coding example](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-neural-network-in-tensorflow/)
* (Optional) [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqOfi41LfDw&list=PLblh5JKOoLUIxGDQs4LFFD--41Vzf-ME1&index=2&ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer)
  * Longer but more in-depth and easy to understand mathematical examples for more intuition
  * Complete Videos 2-9
