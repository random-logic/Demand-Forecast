# 0 - THE BEST OF THE BEST RESOURCE
* You can find it [here](https://chat.openai.com/)
* It will only help your learning and boost your efficiency!
* Use it to write code, but you need to understand the code because there will inevitably be bugs that you need to fix

# 1 - Setup
Setup your environment [here](setup/README.md)

# 2 - Python
Please watch the crash course [here](https://youtu.be/VchuKL44s6E?si=RFeg0qXNQnHdBUP3)
* It would be helpful to replicate the code in the video by writing and running the code in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try)
* No need to memorize everything!

# 3 - Git
* [How Git Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9lnsKot_SQ&ab_channel=ByteByteGo)
    * We will code in alternate branches, and push any finished code to master branch 
* [Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
    * Think twice before *Rewriting History*, these are irreversible!

# 4 - Start Coding
