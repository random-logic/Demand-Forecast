# 0 - THE BEST OF THE BEST RESOURCE
* You can find it [here](https://chat.openai.com/)
* It will only help your learning and boost your efficiency!
* Use it to write code, but you need to understand the code because there will inevitably be bugs that you need to fix

# 1 - Setup
Setup your environment [here](setup/README.md)

# 2 - Python
Please watch the crash course [here](https://youtu.be/VchuKL44s6E?si=RFeg0qXNQnHdBUP3)
* It would be helpful to replicate the code in the video by writing and running the code in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try)
* No need to memorize everything!

# 3 - Git
* [How Git Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9lnsKot_SQ&ab_channel=ByteByteGo)
    * We will code in alternate branches, and push any finished code to master branch 
* [Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
    * Think twice before *Rewriting History*, these are irreversible!

# 4 - Start Coding
Get started [here](start/README.md)

# 5 - ML Crash Course
[ML crash course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression)
* Complete Linear Regression Module

# 6 - Storing Data
These are for references while coding
* [Numpy Cheat Sheet](EDA/Numpy_Python_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)
    * Basically an extension for arrays
* [Pandas Cheat Sheet](EDA/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)
* [Pandas Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRKeLrwfUgU&ab_channel=NicholasRenotte)
    * Just understand how a DataFrame works
* [Tensors Crash Course](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tensor)
    * Just understand how to convert dataframes to Tensors for inputting data into TF

# 7 - EDA and Data Cleaning
* Objective: Figure out how our data looks and what features are relavent to our response variable
* For this project:
    * We will store [data](/dataset/README.md) in data frames
    * Using pairplots and heatmaps for feature relavence will be important
    * We may collectively add other EDA methods or visualizations if it helps with understanding our data or what models to use
    * I recommend use Microsoft Excel for basic data cleaning and Pandas for advanced data manipulation and analysis
    * Create visuals to show if our [variance is constant](/info/constvar/README.md)
* [Relavent Project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yasserh/walmart-sales-prediction-best-ml-algorithms)
    * We will NOT be copying this, this is only to understand how the data should look
* Optional: [EDA Crash Course](https://youtu.be/wPcR9Kmv91g?si=sF7eD7pmOnVdwJen)
    * Some parts may be useful, others are not for this project

# 8 - Machine Learning
* Objective: Predict Sales in future years
* For this project:
    * We will need to split the data into past years (training data) and future years (test data)
    * We plan to implement ARIMA + Neural Network Hybrid Model
* [Relavent Project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yasserh/walmart-sales-prediction-best-ml-algorithms)
    * We will NOT be copying this, this is only to understand the ballpark of how accurate our models should be
* [Concepts](model/README.md)

# 9 - (Optional) Special Topics
* If time allows, we can do extra, such as:
    * Trying [other models](model/README.md)
    * Deploy, train, and test the model in AWS
    * Apply reinforcement learning
    * Add a ChatBot / LLM (huge learning curve, but very valuable for resume)
* I do not have much knowledge in these areas, so we will learn together, and we can collectively post resources
