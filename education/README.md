# 0 - THE BEST OF THE BEST RESOURCE
* You can find it [here](https://chat.openai.com/)
* It will only help your learning and boost your efficiency!
* Use it to write code, but you need to understand the code because there will inevitably be bugs that you need to fix

# 1 - Get Started
Setup your environment [here](setup/README.md)

# 2 - Git
* [How Git Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9lnsKot_SQ&ab_channel=ByteByteGo)
    * We will code in alternate branches, and push any finished code to master branch 
* [Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
    * Think twice before *Rewriting History*, these are irreversible!

# 3 - Python
Please watch the crash course [here](https://youtu.be/VchuKL44s6E?si=RFeg0qXNQnHdBUP3)
* It would be helpful to replicate the code in the video by writing and running the code in a Jupyter Notebook
* No need to memorize everything!

# 4 - EDA + Data Cleaning
* Objective: Figure out how our data looks and what features are relavent to our response variable
    * Definitions: features = inputs, response = output
* For this project:
    * We will store all data in data frames
    * Using pairplots, heatmaps, and t-statistic tests for feature relavence will be important
    * We may collectively add other EDA methods if it helps with understanding our data or what models to use
    * I recommend use Microsoft Excel for basic data cleaning and Pandas for advanced data manipulation and analysis
* [Pandas Cheat Sheet](/education/EDA/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)
* [Pandas Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRKeLrwfUgU&ab_channel=NicholasRenotte)
    * Just understand how a DataFrame works
    * No need to memorize everything!
* Optional: [EDA Crash Course](https://youtu.be/wPcR9Kmv91g?si=sF7eD7pmOnVdwJen)

# Regression


# Deep Learning


# Special Topics
* If time allows, we can do extra, such as:
    * Deploy, train, and test the model in AWS
    * Apply reinforcement learning
    * Add a ChatBot / LLM (huge learning curve, but very valuable for resume)
* I do not have much knowledge in these areas, so we will learn together, and we can collectively post resources
